Integration test


# Test & TDD
It's a strange thing to write about TDD so late in a guide, but it is still most important.

## TDD: is the only way to do it
## unit tests: at the module level
## programming against an interface : first do it, then code impl
## user test automation: for each accepatance test
## test tools : don't, on ROBOT? investigation needed
## mocking : don't



# devops
## continuous integration
## devops
## acceptance tests
