## Pull Request
The purpose of a pull request is to ensure the quality of the work being proposed. The focus should be on the design and the functionality itself. The best way to accomplish this is to read the spec, read the implementation, validate the principle that supports it and conduct an actual test of the feature.

## Who can merge
To merge you have to complete the [DOD](Definition of Done) and have a repository owner give you the green light.
